## 1. INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND

### About Clinikabayan

Clinikabayan is a non-profit organization focused on community-driven healthcare advocacy, dedicated to providing compassionate, accessible, and equitable healthcare to underserved populations throughout the Visayas region. Established in response to the increasing healthcare divide—especially in geographically isolated and economically disadvantaged communities—Clinikabayan asserts that healthcare is not merely a privilege for a select few, but rather a fundamental right for every Filipino.

Rooted in primary healthcare, the organization acts as the initial point of contact for individuals who frequently lack access to essential medical services. Through vital consultations, routine assessments, preventive care, and timely referrals, Clinikabayan connects grassroots needs with reliable and quality health services.

### The Challenge

Numerous communities served by Clinikabayan encounter:
- **Financial limitations** - inability to afford healthcare services
- **Transportation obstacles** - distance from medical facilities
- **Low health literacy** - lack of awareness about health conditions
- **Overcrowded or under-resourced clinics** - limited access to quality care

These situations exacerbate health disparities and postpone life-saving interventions.

### ClinikaCaravan Initiative

At the heart of Clinikabayan's operations is **ClinikaCaravan**, a flagship mobile health initiative that delivers free, on-the-ground medical services directly to rural, remote, and urban impoverished communities. This program offers:
- Medical consultations
- Vaccinations
- First aid services
- Maternal and child care
- Nutritional support
- Chronic disease monitoring
- Comprehensive health education

By physically reaching households unable to travel to distant health centers, this mobile system guarantees continuity of care for vulnerable groups such as low-income families, elderly individuals, persons with disabilities (PWDs), Indigenous Peoples, pregnant women, and young children.

### Organizational Infrastructure

The organization's primary facility serves as the administrative and technological foundation of its operations. This main office would accommodate the **Health Information System (HIS)** utilized for:
- Securely recording patient interactions
- Coordinating referrals
- Tracking program results
- Managing volunteer schedules
- Monitoring inventory
- Generating reports

### Current Operations

Clinikabayan operates under a structured committee-based governance model, bolstered by:
- Trained volunteers
- Healthcare professionals
- Academic collaborators
- Local government units

The network encompasses:
- **32+ partner laboratories** and healthcare facilities throughout the Visayas
- Community leaders
- NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations)
- Corporate sponsors
- National partners

Through collaborative efforts, the organization maintains its field activities, capacity-building initiatives, volunteer training, and CPD-accredited programs for students and professionals.

### Why an Information System is Needed

Currently, Clinikabayan faces several challenges in managing its growing operations:

1. **Manual Record-Keeping Issues**
   - Paper-based patient records are difficult to maintain and retrieve
   - Risk of lost or damaged documents
   - Time-consuming to search for patient history
   - Difficult to track ongoing treatments across multiple visits

2. **Coordination Challenges**
   - Difficulty scheduling volunteers and mobile clinic visits
   - No centralized system for tracking medical supplies
   - Limited visibility of inventory levels across different locations
   - Challenges in coordinating patient referrals to partner hospitals

3. **Data Management Problems**
   - Lack of comprehensive data on patient demographics
   - Inability to generate quick reports on program impact
   - Difficult to identify trends in community health needs
   - No systematic way to measure KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

4. **Communication Barriers**
   - Delayed information sharing between field teams and main office
   - No real-time updates on patient status
   - Inefficient referral process to partner hospitals
   - Limited ability to alert volunteers of schedule changes

5. **Scalability Concerns**
   - As the organization grows, manual systems become unsustainable
   - Need for systematic data collection for grant applications
   - Requirement for transparent reporting to stakeholders
   - Demand for evidence-based program planning

### The Solution: Health Information System

A comprehensive, web-based Health Information System will address these challenges by:
- Digitizing patient records for easy access and security
- Centralizing volunteer scheduling and coordination
- Automating inventory management with low-stock alerts
- Streamlining the referral process with partner hospitals
- Providing real-time dashboards and analytics
- Enabling mobile access for field operations
- Facilitating data-driven decision making
- Supporting transparent reporting to stakeholders
